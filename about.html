                    <p>Hi! I'm Rita Carroll. I'm 24 years old and was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. My mom uprooted me and my siblings young to take us to Colorado, and I've lived here ever since. My favorite part about living in Colorado is the scenic view of the mountains from my front porch.</p>

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <p>Some of my hobbies include drawing digital art, reading (fiction is my favorite), and playing with my dog named Bear. I've worked at a Goodwill in my little town for 8 years now, having the same job since high school. I love the people I work with and enjoy being well-versed in my job.</p>

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <p>I've been back and forth to Pueblo Community College for years, gradually working towards my Media Graphic Design associate's degree. Honestly, I don't know what to do when that is finished, but I want to keep drawing and making art. I've been drawing continuously since middle school.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <p>I have vivid memories of drawing in class notebooks, spending too much time adding detail to fun art projects in elementary school. I've always been a creative kid longing to express herself. Lately, I've been working on morphing my art style into something cute and adorable, with vivid pastel colors and exaggerated features. I hope you stay tuned for my next project. Thank you for reading!</p>
